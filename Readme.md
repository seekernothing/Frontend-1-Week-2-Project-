Task:

Your task is to build an HTML and CSS website that replicates the design presented in the Figma file provided. The website should have accurate styling as depicted in the Figma file and utilize the Montserrat font from Google Fonts. There are four sections in the website.



Requirements:

Sticky Navbar: The navbar should feature the startup logo on the left side and the navigation links on the right side.
Intro Section: This section includes a heading, a paragraph with placeholder text (lorem ipsum), and a button on the left. On the right, there should be an image of Jeff Bezos, which can be exported directly from the Figma file.
Contact Us Section: This part of the website should have custom input fields. When a user clicks on an input field, no blue outline should be visible (Hint: set the outline to none when the input field is focused).
Table Section: Follow the UI design in the Figma file to create a simple table. Additionally, ensure that the table includes a footer created using the 'tfoot' tag.
